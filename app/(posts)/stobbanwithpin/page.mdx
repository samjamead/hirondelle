The best day out of winter 23/24, traversing Stob Bàn. Up from Glen Nevis between Stob Bàn and Sgurr a Mhaim, and then to the summit via the east ridge. Down via the north / north east ridge.

Approaching Stob Bàn from Glen Nevis is a long and teasing effort: You can always see where you need to be, and you can see where the path is leading, but the two don't seem to be obviously destined to rendezvous. And the further you go the more this seems to happen; now you're further away and you've climbed higher than the obvious approach (don't tell me we've got to descend just to climb again?), and what about that buttress, surely we won't have to go all the way around there just to get back to there. The obvious shortcut is just that, obvious, but there looks to be a lot of water in between here and there, and doesn't that bit look quite steep?

Whichever route you take, gradually and then suddenly you arrive right into the thick of things.
