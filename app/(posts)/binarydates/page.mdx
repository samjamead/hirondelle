I swapped all the post dates to 8-bit binary. Why not! I think they&apos;re
fun.

Have a go:

## What the heck is 8-bit binary?!

You're probably familiar with binary being a series of zeros and ones, that
when mashed together can mean other numbers (or letters or symbols).

Binary is the base-2 numeral system, ultimately what the computer turns
everything into in order to 'run' it, and if it was good enough to power the
Apollo moon missions then it's good enough for dates on a blog.
