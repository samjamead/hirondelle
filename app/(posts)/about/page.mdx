    Les hirondelles are pretty cool birds. They zoom around like maniacs, often
    skimming surfaces (fields, water, rooftops) in flight, before wheeling away
    to start the next lap, evading imaginary TIE fighters.{' '}

    All the while they chirrup away, a language evocative of an afro-polynesian
    hybrid patois, covering who-knows what kind of a range of topics that can
    only be discussed on the wing.
