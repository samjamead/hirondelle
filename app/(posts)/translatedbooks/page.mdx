        Write two paragraphs explaining that I've read a series of old novels
        translated from their original language, and through my own
        slapdash 'buy now!' attitude I accidentally bought versions from
        publishers who have turned out to be not the most reputable. Twice
        I realised that the authors work was not being shown in it's best
        light; the translator is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, and the
        author comes off second best. The two books were Kakfa 'The Stoker'
        and Flaubert 'Madame Bovary'. TL;DR make sure you're buying
        reputable versions of old translated novels.

        Recently, I've embarked on a journey through a series of classic novels translated from their original languages. However, my enthusiasm for quick purchases led me to an unexpected realization. In my haste, I inadvertently acquired versions from less reputable publishers, a mistake that significantly impacted my reading experience. On two separate occasions, I found myself grappling with translations that failed to do justice to the original works, leaving me with the distinct impression that the translators were shouldering much of the burden, while the authors' brilliance was inadvertently diminished.

        The first instance of this occurred with Franz Kafka's "The Stoker," followed by Gustave Flaubert's "Madame Bovary." In both cases, the nuances and poetic qualities of the original text seemed to be lost in translation, robbing me of the full depth and beauty of these renowned works. This experience has been a stark reminder of the crucial role that reputable translations play in preserving the integrity of classic literature. The lesson learned? When it comes to translated novels, especially those of considerable age and literary significance, it's imperative to seek out editions from trusted, well-regarded publishers to ensure you're experiencing the author's work in its best possible light.

        I'm not sure if this is a problem that's unique to me, or if it's more widespread. I'd be interested to hear from others who have encountered similar issues or have any thoughts on the matter.
