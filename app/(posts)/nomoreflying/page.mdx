I haven't flown this year (2024) but I have made eight (and counting!) overseas trips:

- France in January
- Scotland in February
- London in April
- France in May
- France and Italy in May
- London in June
- Devon in July
- France in August

Overall, compared to flying, the time spent travelling has increased by about 10x, the cost has increased by about 4x, but the enjoyment and fulfilment of these journeys has increased infinitely.

Here are some of the reasons why I don't want to fly anymore:
