I haven't flown this year (2024) but I have made nine (and counting!) overseas trips:

- France in January
- Scotland in February
- London in April
- France in May
- France and Italy in May
- London and Wales in June
- Devon in July
- France in August
- Yorkshire, London, Devon, and France in September

Overall, compared to flying, the time spent travelling has increased by about 10x, the cost has increased by about 4x, but the enjoyment and fulfilment of these journeys has increased infinitely.

At the end of this year I'll tot up the numbers and make a comparison.

Here are some of the reasons why I don't want to fly anymore (growing list):
