After 20 minutes of the game against Ireland, this England fan was convinced. The Steve Borthwick experiment was working! Maybe the empty post-match platitudes trotted out after the Autumn Internationals weren't so empty after all... Maybe there _were_ positives to be taken from repeatedly turning slender leads at half time into narrow defeats. Maybe 'the group' _had_ been coming together all this time, peaking just when the games really mattered. Maybe there _was_ progress being made every week back at Pennyhill Park.

Alas, 60 minutes later I was seeing clearly again. Another exciting start! Another slender lead at half time! All leading to... another narrow defeat? Aha, a trend is emerging, and the trend has a name. Behold, The England Game Plan!

The England vs Ireland started brightly, but the second half was boring at best, England just kicking Ireland the ball and waiting for them to score.

England looked awesome for 20 minutes and then The England Game Plan came along and ruined the game.

Ireland wern’t at their best and England were looking really sharp. You’ve got to know when to press. We gave Ireland so much terratory and possession that we allowed them to get their rhythm back, connect some loose wires, and by the time they’d rumbled into life… oh. We didn’t have enough points. England were winning the breakdown (offensively and defensively). Even managed to keep JVF quiet.

We’re blessed to have the access that we do For all of the camaraderie on camera during each episode of This Rose, it’s clear that the camp isn’t settled. The junior players play with fear. This is hardly surprising given the ‘rousing’ speeches given by Ellis Genge in the huddle. Get out there and fucking bash them… Or else! It’s the or else that’s the worrying bit. The players are clamming up. To illustrate the point I’d like to use the case study of Calen Murley, analysing his performance pre- and post-The England Game Plan being stamped on things. In the first 20 minutes he looked really sharp on both ends, bright, sprightly, quick, earnest. Doing his best impression of Lt. Furbank with that snippy moustache. A particular highlight was him and Henry Slade deftly snuffing out an overlap, the Irish looking threatening down their left wing. But then. TEGP. Ellis Genge looming over his pillow. How else do you explain Caden Murley trying to RUN the ball out from his own dead ball line, not once, but TWICE. How has one of the senior players not jogged over after that first one and had a quiet word – just dot it down next time pet. Rugby players are people. How can you not expect a 30-something bull with X caps affecting a 20-something n00b winning his second?

England did very well to hold on, actually, during the second and third quarter.

Ben O Keef great ref love his approach but both him and the two ARs got a little whistle happy. Closing the gap on a bum throw? Penalty against Genge at one end (when Genge had the upper hand), reset the scrum for the same thing down the other end?

A lot has been made of the kicking game dominating. Thowing Marcus Smith to fullback to compete with James Lowe and Hugo Keenan is a slap in the face for all premiership fullbacks.

Hoiking Steward not Murley. Throwing on Harry Randall and asking him to win the game, down 20 points away to Ireland, double defending grand slam winning Ireland?

What’s the point of the replacement scrum half? Mitchel was having a good game, finding the right balance of calm consistency with the odd dart to keep the guards honest. Randall can’t come in to that situation. He looks good at Bristol because the ball is served up on a plate and the opposition isn’t _desperate_ like it is at international level. In a test match you have to go and get the ball.

In the post-apocolyptic world of 2025, where the internet is dominated by short form video, I think there’s still an appetite for the good ol’ fashioned written word. Much easier to consume at work while ‘working’.

Gordon D’Arcy mentioned it in the commentary: if you stick to the game plan but the game plan isn’t working, surely you’ve got to try something different? The England squad is experienced enough and good enough at club level that they should be able to sense that
