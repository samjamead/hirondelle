Monday to Thursday I'm the [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samjamead/) at [Battenhall](https://www.battenhall.com/), an award winning comms agency in Clerkenwell. But on Friday I'm available for hire! I build web apps, analyse data, build websites, and write copy for all kinds of clients.

In the last eight years I have been lucky to work with clients from a wide range of industries. Most recently, I've designed and built a monitoring and evaluation platform for a marine conservation charity, analysed datasets for engineering consultancies, and built websites for clients ranging from an NFT artist to a group of healthcare professionals.
