        Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy
        rain was still falling. Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in
        a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection. &quot;Come on,
        girl,&quot; said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms, he carried her
        over the mud. Ekido did not speak again until that night when they
        reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself.
        &quot;We monks don&apos;t go near females,&quot; he told Tanzan,
        &quot;especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you
        do that?&quot; &quot;I left the girl there,&quot; said Tanzan. &quot;Are
        you still carrying her?&quot;
