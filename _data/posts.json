    "quote": "The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. This was captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socio-economic unfairness.",

Rocks, ledges and sunny grassy hollows alternate with one another. One can play here hide-and-seek with the wind, lounge in some sheltered recess, look for mountain flowers, or feed on berries. I did none of these things, for I had the 5:40 train to catch at Crianlarich. My ascent was a breathless affair, with an eye on the watch. ",

    "quote": "Why don’t whales, that live in salt water and have salt water pass through their mouths, die of thirst? Why doesn’t the fresh water in a marine mammal’s body flow out into the salt water that surrounds it? The answer is that marine mammals and fish have a number of adaptations that allow them to conserve fresh water and excrete salt very effectively. It’s not the cod liver oil you want, it’s the cod’s liver. A liver that can filter the ocean must have other uses. If I had a cod’s liver I bet I could drink a keg of beer and piss turpentine. I could pour soy sauce in my miso soup and drink it with a spoon made of anchovies. Oh, to have the liver of a seal!",
